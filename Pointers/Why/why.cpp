	// of x's value... in contrast to passing any non-pointer value.

	// So that's the first real reason to use pointers: to pass a value without
	// duplicating it, especially important for large (memory wise) values.



	// What if we wanted to change TWO values? Can we return two values
	// from a function? NO!
	double angle, gunpowder;

	// So there's our second reason: multiple return values.
